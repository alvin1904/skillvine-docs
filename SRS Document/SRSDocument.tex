\section{Overall Description}
\subsection{Product Perspective}
\emph{The Activity Points Management System is a one-of-a-kind solution and currently, there is no other system that performs the same task. The system can replace the current manual procedures for the task, as it is capable of adapting to this purpose.\\
Our system automates the entire process of grading and managing certificates. It can also offer a safe and convenient storage system for students to keep their certificates. The user-friendly interface makes it a breeze for both teachers and students to navigate. This can simplify the way teachers monitor each student's progress and number of activity points achieved.\\
}
\subsection{Product Features}
\emph{The system contains the following major features:
\begin{itemize}
    \item User authentication for students \& teachers.
    \item Interactive dashboards for students \& teachers.
    \item Adding, editing, \& displaying certificates with details.
    \item Real-time viewing of activity points \& certificate status
    \item Storage feature to organize \& maintain records of all certificates.
    \item Notification system for updates to previously interacted certificates.
    \item Sorting, searching, \& filtering of certificates for students \& teachers.
    \item Grading or rejecting certificates with remarks for teachers.
    \item Automatic calculation \& updating of activity points in the database.
\end{itemize}
}
\subsection{User Classes and Characteristics}
\emph{
The system will consist of two fundamental user roles - students and teachers.
\begin{enumerate}
    \item Students: These users will upload certificates and their details and also have their own dashboards. These users are interested in knowing their activity points real time.
    \item Teachers: These users can add, delete, update and view the students' certificates' details. They can also assign points to certificates uploaded by the students.
\end{enumerate}
}
\subsection{Operating Environment}
\emph{
The activity points management application will be web-based and can be accessed through commonly used web browsers such as Google Chrome, Mozilla Firefox, Safari, and Microsoft Edge. It will work seamlessly on any operating system that supports web browsers, including Windows, MacOS, Linux, iOS, and Android, and can be accessed through standard personal computers or mobile devices with internet connectivity. The application will be self-contained and won't require any additional software to function.
